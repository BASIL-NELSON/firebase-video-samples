# Firebase Video Samples

This repository contains sample code for some of the videos on the [Firebase
YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/firebase).

## How to use this project

Some of the projects might be fully functional sample apps, some might just
contain the code snippets we used in our videos.

We make this code available as-is.
